# Prototype-Pattern

A follow-along example of an implementation of the prototype design pattern
in the Java programming language.

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern as described
by the Gang of Four. 

It is useful in addressing:
  -excessive subclassing
  -overhead of invoking "new" operator
  -object creation at run-time
